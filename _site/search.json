    "text": "Disclosures & Limitations\n\nThe Data\nIn the data, loans were disbursed to many claims that did not fill the forms completely. I examined this entire situation in my DATA607 project. Many items were self reported with little fact check. Business loans were approved by lenders and forgiven by the SBA in what seems like a haphazard manner.\nThere might be identifying data that was excluded from the SBA’s release such as liscense numbers, EIN numbers, and Social Security numbers. But in that case, I wonder why so many business addresses and names were missing? Additionally there are observations exempt whose information is protected by law( whose verbiage by the way is incredibly broad).\n\n\nThe Work\nThis project is not finished as it takes took longer than I had imagined to examine 11 million data points. However, in retrospect, because of the magnitude of observations, the hypothesis would have better fit as a normal distribution had I taken a random sample of the data. It is certainly too late now but its something I did not think of at the time."
